muIR-lib is a library of hardware components wirtten in Chisel for auto generating highly configurable parallel dataflow accelerator. muIR-lib provides the implementation of the following hardware units:

1. A set of highly configurable and parameterizable computation nodes.
2. A set of control units to support arbitrary control path.
3. A collection configurable Memory structures like Cache, Scratchpad memory, and such.
4. A set of standard flexible set of junctions and interfaces to connect different pieces of the design.
