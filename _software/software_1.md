muIR-sim is a new simulation environment that improves software and hardware integration and simulation accuracy compare to functional simulation. One of the goals of this framework is integration the hardware development process into the software stack from the beginning, allowing features to be incrementally implemented and evaluated as workloads evolve over time.
