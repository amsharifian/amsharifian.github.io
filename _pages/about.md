I am a _Computer Architecture Ph.D._ candidate in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University(SFU) advised by [Arrvindh Shriraman](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/). My thesis project has been building [Dandelion](https://github.com/sfu-arch/dandelion-lib) a microarchitecture intermediate representation, call it $$\mu IR$$, that helps computer architecture designers to abstract their accelerator design into an IR. Using $$\mu IR$$ designers can: analysis, transform and optimize their accelerator and find a design that matches their goal. I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering-Hardware from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran in 2014.

Since summer 2018, I joined **Huawei Technologies**, Hardware Acceleration Lab, as a Research Engineer.

I release my projects on our lab's repo, [sfu-arch](https://github.com/sfu-arch), every six months. Feel free to test them and you are more than welcome to give me your feedbacks.
