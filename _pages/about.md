I do computer architecture and programming languages. I like to develop frameworks and that break down abstraction barriers and rethinks the hardware–software interface. I worked with the [Architecture Research Group](http://banyanlab.cs.sfu.ca/) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) advised by [Arrvindh Shriraman](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/).

During my Phd I worked on High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools and developed a framework -- µIR -- that can generate parallel hardware accelerators from your high-level program in C/C++ and Cilk for FPGAs.
