I am Amirali Sharifian, third-year PhD student at Simon Fraser University(SFU). I am working in Computer Architecture Research lab at SFU advised by [Arrvindh Shriraman](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/).

From summer 2018, I started working at **Huawei Technology**, Hardware Acceleration Lab, as a Research Engineer while I'm continuing my PhD.

I'm developing **_Dandelion_** during my PhD. [Dandelion](https://github.com/sfu-arch/dandelion-lib) is a microarchitecture intermediate representation, call it $$\mu IR$$, that helps computer architecture designers to abstract their accelerator design to an IR. Using Dandelion designers can: analysis, transform and optimize their accelerator and find a design that matches their goal.

I have released my projects on our lab's repo, [sfu-arch](https://github.com/sfu-arch). Feel free to test them and you are more than welcome to give me your feedbacks.
